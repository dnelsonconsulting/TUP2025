# Resolve missing type name error (2025-06-23 17:07Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find name 'SuccessStepProps'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

I can see the issue. The `SuccessStepProps` interface is commented out, but the function is still trying to use it. I'll uncomment the interface to fix the error.


---

```diff
  import { CheckCircleIcon } from "@heroicons/react/24/solid";
  
- //interface SuccessStepProps {
-   //message?: string;
- //}
+ interface SuccessStepProps {
+   message?: string;
+ }
  
  export default function SuccessStep({ message }: SuccessStepProps) {
```

---

The error is now resolved! I uncommented the `SuccessStepProps` interface that defines the `message` prop as an optional string. This provides the proper TypeScript typing for the component's props.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type '`t${number}CountryCode`' can't be used to index type '{ firstName: string; lastName: string; middleName: string; additionalName: string; studentType: string; degreeLevel: string; gender: string; birthDate: string; personalEmail: string; notes: string; ... 15 more ...; transcript4: null; }'.
```

The error occurs because TypeScript can't infer the dynamic property names. I'll fix this by using type assertion to tell TypeScript that the dynamic property access is valid.


---

```diff
    const nationalIDFilename = `${baseFileName}_${formData.nationalCountryCode}-ID`;
    const transcriptFileNames = [1,2,3,4].map(num =>
-     formData[`t${num}CountryCode`]
-       ? `${baseFileName}_${formData[`t${num}CountryCode`]}-T${num}`
+     (formData as any)[`t${num}CountryCode`]
+       ? `${baseFileName}_${(formData as any)[`t${num}CountryCode`]}-T${num}`
        : ''
    );
```

---

The error is now resolved! I added `(formData as any)` type assertions to tell TypeScript that the dynamic property access is intentional and safe. This allows the code to access properties like `t1CountryCode`, `t2CountryCode`, etc. without TypeScript complaining about the dynamic property names.
