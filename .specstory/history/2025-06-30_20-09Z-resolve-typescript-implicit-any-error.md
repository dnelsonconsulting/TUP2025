# Resolve TypeScript implicit any error (2025-06-30 20:09Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Parameter 'form' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

I can see the TypeScript error is due to the `form` parameter not having a type annotation. Let me check the types file to see what type should be used for the form parameter.

Read file: transcript-uploader/src/utils/types.ts

Perfect! I can see there's already a `FormData` interface defined. I'll fix the TypeScript error by adding the proper type annotation to the `form` parameter.

I see the issue - there's a naming conflict with the global `FormData` constructor. Let me fix this by using a type-only import and renaming the interface to avoid the conflict.

Perfect! The TypeScript error has been resolved. The fix involved:

1. **Adding a type-only import** for the `FormData` interface from the types file
2. **Renaming it to `ApplicationFormData`** to avoid conflict with the global `FormData` constructor
3. **Adding the type annotation** to the `form` parameter: `form: ApplicationFormData`

This resolves the "Parameter 'form' implicitly has an 'any' type" error while avoiding naming conflicts with the built-in `FormData` constructor used later in the function.
